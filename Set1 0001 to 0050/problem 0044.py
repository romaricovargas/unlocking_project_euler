Problem 44
PENTAGON NUMBERS

Pentagon numbers are generated by the formula P(n) = n(3n-1)/2. 
The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145 ...

It can be seen that P(4) + P(1) = 22 + 70 = 92 = P(8). 
However, their difference, 70-22=48, is not pentagonal.
Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P(j) and P(k) for which 
their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P(k) - P(j)| is minimised; 
what is the value of D?
